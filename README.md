# Vidlii Downloader
This is a simple Python script that downloads videos from [Vidlii](https://www.vidlii.com/), a video sharing site reminiscent of old YouTube. I'm aiming for compatibility with both Windows and Linux. There is no reason I can think of for it not to work on Mac or other OSes such as BSD, but it isn't guarenteed.

Developed and tested on Python 3.11.2, will likely work on many if not all versions of Python 3.
